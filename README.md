MASTER MIND GAME

Rules
Try to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten turns.
After submitting a row, a small black peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position.
A white peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.
And a cross represents the wrong color code.

Functionality
There are total six colors on the right side of the app as you can see (by default, the 1st one is selected).
Clicking on any color makes it selected.
Now, you have to fill each row by coloring all circles in it, by color of your choice (but remember, you have to win the game so do it intelligently ).
